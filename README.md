# Triangles Of Light
This was my TUBerlin Summer University Project as a part of the UTS FEIT BUILD Program. 

I've added a more detailed project abstract with the project that describes the motivation for this physical prototype. This project was made in less than two weeks, with a limited budget, electrical engineering knowledge and supplies. This was a project idea that was inspired by feedback, lights and interactive media.

### Equipment I used
1. Plexi-glass for aesthetic
2. Arduino Uno + starter kit
3. Push-buttons 
4. WS2811 LED Strips
5. Soldering Iron + kit 
6. Plywood
7. Cable ties
8. Hot glue

### To run the code

1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Install FastLED 
3. Check to see if you connected your wires correctly
4. Plug in your Arduino and play!

### Assembly
